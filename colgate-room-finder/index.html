									<p id="section-title">Why the need?</p>
									<p>Among our team members, finding our way to an irregularly used meeting room has always been a frustration as this task falls anywhere in the range from being managably challenging to a frantic nightmare. Now that we had some resources, we reached out to fellow employees in the facility and found that their responses echoed our sentiment. </p>
									<p>Then the next question to answer was: why a mobile app? That is to ask, why are maps on flyers and walls not good enough?</p>
									<p>Physical maps are suboptimal because the facility was sprawling and its layout was not incredibly intuitive. Physical maps would then have to be correspondingly huge to accomodate every room of significance. With huge maps come the requirement for big wall spaces in multiple areas &mdash; something that was not planned for. An interactive mobile navigation/map app rises above these constraints.</p>
									<p>The the lower bound value for the app was estimated as such: There are about 1000 employees in the facility. We assume each employee has one meeting in an infrequented room once a month. Next, assume 50% would require around 10 minutes more to get to their room due to confusion and getting lost. That amounts to about 5000 minutes per month or 1000 hours a year lost. This number jumps if we take into account the drop in productivity for the whole team due a key member's tardiness. This became the value proposition for the app.</p>
								<hr class="short-bold">
								</li>
<!--He had also been looking at the feasibility of a few ways to implement indoor navigation. Due to the size of the facility, using beacons (location transmitters) turned out to be very costly and thus unjustifiable.-->
                                <li class="work-text">
									
									<p id="section-title">Approach</p>
									<p>Basically, as a minimum viable product, the app has to allow users to search for a room (or select it from their events calendar), and then direct them to that room from their current location. As Colgate had recently migrated over to using Google Apps (G Suite), integration with Google Calendar was also included as a deliverable.</p>
									<p>Next, we sampled characteristics from our target audience and created a user persona which served as a point of reference for our designs. We also drafted out a user flow and with that, drew a set of low-fidelity wireframes and connected them to form a user journey.</p>

									<p id="section-title">Usability Testing</p>
									<p>A month and a half into design and development, we decided to conduct our first official usability tests with the prototype. I drafted out a test script and recorded our findings. After collecting and sorting user feedback, I plotted a graph with sticky notes:
									</p>
									<div class="col-xs-12">
										<img src="/images/work/room-finder/cpmaps-plot.png" alt="" class="img-responsive col-md-10 col-md-offset-1" style="margin-bottom:25px;"/>
									</div>
									<hr class="short-bold">
								</li>
								<li class="work-text">
									<p id="section-title">Analysis &amp; Solutions</p>
									<p>The items on the chart above can be separated into a few groups:</p>
									<p>&bull; Technical issues: expiration of Google token <br> &bull; Issues that involve other departments: searching by person name <br> &bull; Issues that have a clear-cut solution: adding more room aliases, resetting map orientation, double-tapping to zoom, etc.</p>
									<p>I did not focus on solving the above issues due to their stated natures, and instead I directed my attention to what's left. </p>
									<p>These were issues that required more thought and they happen to be items in the bottom-right quadrant, i.e. items that provide considerable value to the user and could be reasonably be implemented in the following weeks: </p>
								</li>
								<li class="work-text">
									<div class="col-xs-12" style="margin-bottom:30px">
										<img style="border-radius:200px" src="/images/work/room-finder/cpmaps-calendar-icon.png" alt="" class="img-responsive col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"/>
									</div>
									<p id="section-subtitle">Google Calendar icon</p>
									<p>One thing that was surprising was that users did not realize what the calendar icon represented. One who did thought it was just an in-app calendar that has nothing to do with Google Calendar.</p>
									<p>As integration with Google Calendar is a key feature of the app, I attempted a redesign that resembles Google's Calendar icon, hoping to cash in on users' familiarity with it. Among our users, the new icon was more effective in conveying 'Google Calendar.'</p>

									<div class="col-md-4">

									</div>
								</li>
								<li class="work-text">
								<p id="section-subtitle">Self-location</p>
								<p>As location services were extremely inconsistent indoors and beacons were impractical, the simplest solution that we could think of was to have users locate themselves. They would search for their room/cubicle number or drop a location pin on the map.</p>
								<p>After sketching a set of wireframes, I proceeded to make a high-fidelity prototype for this particular interaction. As my time at Colgate was drawing to an end, formal user interviews could not be carried out, but from surveying a few co-workers, I received positive feedback.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="work-text">
									<div class="col-xs-12">
										<img src="/images/work/room-finder/cpmaps-bluedot-icon.png" alt="" class="img-responsive col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"/>
									</div>
									<p id="section-subtitle">The blue dot</p>
									<p>One other thing I worked on was the blue dot that indicates the user's location because it was apparent from user interviews that they wanted to orient themselves on the map. In my first attempt, I placed a white location services icon in the center of the blue dot. This however, is too similar to the navigate floating button on the app. Hence, I decided to mimic Google Maps' oriented blue dot instead.</p>
<!--									<p>Before I left Colgate, I created a few assets that could indicate orientation to replace the plain blue dot. I handed these to the developer. </p>-->

										<p id="section-title">What's next?</p>
										<p>Though this project was initiated primarily to explore the potential use of indoor navigation at Colgate facilites, it evidently evolved into a product that provides significant value to employees and visitors alike.</p>
										<p>I see great potential in the future of this app. For example, it could be enhanced to include functionalities like providing emergency evacuation and visitor orientation routes, booking rooms, locating parking spaces and the closest equipments such as defibrillators, fire extinguishers, printers, and more.</p>
<!--										<p>Overall, this project was extremely challenging and rewarding, mainly due to the fact that I had almost no experience with UX prior to working on this mobile application. It pushed me to spend hours upon hours reading articles, listening to podcasts, and watching tutorial videos to compensate. My manager and colleagues were kind and very forgiving of me being an amateur, but at the same time provided me with a great environment and exposure to kickstart my journey into UX design.</p>-->
